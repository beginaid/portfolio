I have been belonging to the demo ski team for 5 years and played the role of captain. We have over 50 members and our dream was to become the strongest team in 48 years history. In the end, we achieved the goal: we won the championship in the Kansai region and reached a podium in the national convention.<br>

                I have managed some web medium for my academic output or individual branding. "Beginaid" is the main media and over 20000 people visit this web media every month. This title is made of two words: "Beginners" and "Band-aid". At first, I wanted to help lonely beginners on the Internet. That is, there is much information on the Internet while the information lacks a source of a quote or "reshape" the original information for their sake. On the other hand, in some cases, we cannot find the data we want to get. In other words, beginners are poor at solving their problems on the Internet because of the lack of plenty or information on the Web site. In order to help those beginners: to let them the strongest band-aid, I write accurate and unique articles. This media has over 650 articles which are all made by my work.

                I have worked at a cram school for 4 years. This is because my dream was to be a teacher. Through studying, I wanted to let students know how fun to know gain knowledge and how important to be independent in all areas of life. Along with this policy, we managed the cram school to be a "3rd place" for students. The 1st place is certainly family. Then the 2nd place in school. Generally speaking, we have these two places in my childhood. However, in some cases, it is not enough to gratify their curiosity or let children get independency. Therefore, our cram school seeks to become a 3rd place which is neither family nor school. We should play a role in what the two places cannot do.

                I went to DaNang (Vietnam) for 4 months as an exchange student. I belonged to the International Business Management course and learned how developing countries like Vietnam should go along with developed countries. There are various kinds of classes such as "Leadership", "Cross-cultural management" and "Contemporary Issues of International Business". In those classes, I had learned about what is leadership, what brings us a "good" leader, how should we construct relationships among leaders and members, what is culture, what is the difference between capitalism and socialism, how can we use design thinking in the context of business, and how is the difference between emerging countries and developed countries. Also, I had a really important experience there. Actually, I went to DaNang for the first time from Kyoto University. Therefore, I had a hard time living there. Then, many friends helped me to spend time in DaNang and even took me to enjoy sightseeing. At first, I couldn’t understand why they welcomed me so much. I was just one exchange student from Japan. I wondered they didn’t have to devote so much time to hang out with me. However, the more I knew about Vietnam, the more I got it. That is, all Vietnamese think plenty of families. In the same way, they welcomed me so much. I feel as if I were a member of your families. Really honored about it.
